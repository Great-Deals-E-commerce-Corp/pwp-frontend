# PromoPlan Pro

## Introduction

PromoPlan Pro is a comprehensive, AI-powered web application designed to streamline the creation, approval, and management of promotional campaigns. It serves as a central hub for various teams—including Commercial, Shop Operations (ShopOps), and Finance—to collaborate effectively on trade marketing initiatives. By digitizing the entire workflow from campaign inception to operational execution, PromoPlan Pro reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and accelerates the time-to-market for promotions.

At its core, the application features an intelligent Trade Letter Scanner that uses AI to pre-fill campaign forms, a direct submission-to-validation workflow, and dedicated dashboards tailored to the needs of each user.
